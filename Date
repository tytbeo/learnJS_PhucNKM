Write a program that, given a date in 2009, determines the day of week on that date.

Example

For D = 1 , M = 1, the output should be Date(D, M) = "Thursday"
For D = 17, M = 1, the output should be Date(D, M) = "Saturday"


function date(d, m){
    let day = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
    let x = new Date(2009,m-1,d);
    return day[x.getDay()];
}
