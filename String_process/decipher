Consider the following ciphering algorithm:

For each character replace it with its code.
Concatenate all of the obtained numbers.
Given a ciphered string, return the initial one if it is known that it consists only of lowercase letters.

Note: here the character's code means its decimal ASCII code, the numerical representation of a character used by most modern programming languages.

Example

For cipher = "10197115121", the output should be
decipher(cipher) = "easy".

Explanation: charCode('e') = 101, charCode('a') = 97, charCode('s') = 115 and charCode('y') = 121.


function decipher(cipher){
    let rs = "";
    for(let i = 0;i<cipher.length;i+=2){
        let x = cipher.substr(i,2);
        if( x < 97 ){
            x = cipher.substr(i,3);
            i++;
        }
        rs += String.fromCharCode(x);
    }
    return rs;
}
