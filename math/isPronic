A pronic number (also known as oblongnumber, rectangular number or heteromecic number), is a number which is the product of two consecutive integers, i.e. it can be represented as x * (x + 1) for some integer x. The first few pronic numbers are:

0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42...

Here's why:

0 = 0 × 1
2 = 1 × 2
6 = 2 × 3
12 = 3 × 4
20 = 4 × 5
30 = 5 × 6
42 = 6 × 7
Your task is to write a function isPronic which checks whether the number n is a pronic number and returns true if it is and falseotherwise.


function isPronic(n){
    for(let i = 0; ; i++){
        let check = i * ( i + 1);
        if( check > n ){
            return false;
        } else if ( check == n ){
            return true;
        }
    }
}
